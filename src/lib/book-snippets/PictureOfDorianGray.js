        <p> The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind
        stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of
        the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn. </p>

        <p> From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as
        was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the
        honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed
        hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the
        fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that
        were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect,
        and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium
        of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.
        The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or
        circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,
        seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon
        note of a distant organ. </p>

        <p> In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait
        of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance
        away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years
        ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange
        conjectures. </p>

        <p> As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in
        his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But
        he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though
        he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might
        awake. </p>

        <p> "It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry
        languidly. "You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large
        and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I
        have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have
        not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place."
        </p>

        <p> "I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head back in that
        odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. "No, I won't send it
        anywhere." </p>

        <p> Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue
        wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted
        cigarette. "Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps
        you painters are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have
        one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in
        the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait
        like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite
        jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion." </p>

        <p> "I know you will laugh at me," he replied, "but I really can't exhibit it. I have put
        too much of myself into it." </p>

        <p> Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed. </p>

        <p> "Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same." </p>

        <p> "Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I
        really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your
        coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and
        rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you&mdash;well, of course you have
        an intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an
        intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys
        the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all
        forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned
        professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in
        the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told
        to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks
        absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but
        whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some
        brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to
        look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't
        flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him." </p>

        <p> "You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist. "Of course I am not like him. I
        know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your
        shoulders? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and
        intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the
        faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and
        the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the
        play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.
        They live as we all should live&mdash;undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They
        neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth,
        Harry; my brains, such as they are&mdash;my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's
        good looks&mdash;we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly." </p>

        <p> "Dorian Gray? Is that his name?" asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards
        Basil Hallward. </p>

        <p> "Yes, that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you." </p>

        <p> "But why not?" </p>

        <p> "Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any
        one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be
        the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing
        is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am
        going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow
        it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you think me awfully
        foolish about it?" </p>

        <p> "Not at all," answered Lord Henry, "not at all, my dear Basil. You seem to forget that
        I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely
        necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I
        am doing. When we meet&mdash;we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down
        to the Duke's&mdash;we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces.
        My wife is very good at it&mdash;much better, in fact, than I am. She never gets confused
        over her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I
        sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me." </p>

        <p> "I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry," said Basil Hallward,
        strolling towards the door that led into the garden. "I believe that you are really a very
        good husband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an
        extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your
        cynicism is simply a pose." </p>

        <p> "Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know," cried Lord
        Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced
        themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The
        sunlight slipped over the polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous. </p>

        <p> After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. "I am afraid I must be going, Basil,"
        he murmured, "and before I go, I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time
        ago." </p>

        <p> "What is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground. </p>

        <p> "You know quite well." </p>

        <p> "I do not, Harry." </p>

        <p> "Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit
        Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason." </p>

        <p> "I told you the real reason." </p>

        <p> "No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it. Now,
        that is childish." </p>

        <p> "Harry," said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, "every portrait that is
        painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely
        the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the
        painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this
        picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul." </p>

        <p> Lord Henry laughed. "And what is that?" he asked. </p>

        <p> "I will tell you," said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came over his face.
        </p>

        <p> "I am all expectation, Basil," continued his companion, glancing at him. </p>
