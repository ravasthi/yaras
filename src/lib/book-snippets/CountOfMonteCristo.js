        </h3>

        <p>
          On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the
          three-master, the <em>Pharaon</em> from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.
        </p>

        <p>
          As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d&rsquo;If,
          got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.
        </p>

        <p>
          Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were
          covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to
          come into port, especially when this ship, like the <em>Pharaon</em>, has
          been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an
          owner of the city.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic
          shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled
          Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but
          so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the
          forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened
          on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any
          accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down
          with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill,
          the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the
          pilot, who was steering the <em>Pharaon</em> towards the narrow entrance of
          the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye,
          watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the
          pilot.
        </p>

        <p>
          The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much
          affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel
          in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside
          the <em>Pharaon</em>, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station
          by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship&rsquo;s bulwarks.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black
          eyes, and hair as dark as a raven&rsquo;s wing; and his whole appearance
          bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their
          cradle to contend with danger.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Ah, is it you, Dantès?&rdquo; cried the man in the skiff. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
          the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;A great misfortune, M. Morrel,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;a
          great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave
          Captain Leclere.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;And the cargo?&rdquo; inquired the owner, eagerly.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that
          head. But poor Captain Leclere&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;What happened to him?&rdquo; asked the owner, with an air of
          considerable resignation. &ldquo;What happened to the worthy captain?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;He died.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Fell into the sea?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.&rdquo; Then
          turning to the crew, he said, &ldquo;Bear a hand there, to take in sail!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the
          crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and
          outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail
          clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his
          orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the
          owner.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;And how did this misfortune occur?&rdquo; inquired the latter,
          resuming the interrupted conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with
          the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.
          In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days
          afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest,
          sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his
          heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of
          honor. It was worth while, truly,&rdquo; added the young man with a
          melancholy smile, &ldquo;to make war against the English for ten years,
          and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Why, you see, Edmond,&rdquo; replied the owner, who appeared more
          comforted at every moment, &ldquo;we are all mortal, and the old must make
          way for the young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you
          assure me that the cargo&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise
          you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:
          &ldquo;Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a
          man-of-war.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Let go&mdash;and clue up!&rdquo; At this last command all the sails
          were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said Dantès,
          observing the owner&rsquo;s impatience, &ldquo;here is your supercargo, M.
          Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every
          particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship
          in mourning.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which
          Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a
          sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his
          task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner.
          He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing
          countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates;
          and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which
          is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew
          as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Well, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;you have heard of the
          misfortune that has befallen us?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest
          man.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable
          service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so
          important as that of Morrel &amp; Son,&rdquo; replied Danglars.
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was
          watching the anchoring of his vessel, &ldquo;it seems to me that a sailor
          needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for
          our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require
          instruction from anyone.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with
          hate. &ldquo;Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident.
          Scarcely was the captain&rsquo;s breath out of his body when he assumed
          the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and
          a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.&rdquo;
